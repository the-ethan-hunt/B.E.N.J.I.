You can always type in your commands in the Command Box and hit 'Enter' and B.E.N.J.I. will obey your orders.

The commands for the various functions are as follows:

* "***Who are you/Identify Youself/What is your name***" for B.E.N.J.I. to introduce itself.
* "***note*** _NoteContent_" to add a note. The note is saved on your desktop.
* "***recorder*** _VideoName_ _AudioName_" to initiate screen recorder. If only "***recorder***" is used, it will use "UScreenCapture" and "Microphone (Realtek High Definition Audio)" as default video and audio. You can choose them, by using "ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy" in command prompt. If only "***recorder*** _VideoName_" is used, then the audio will be chosen as per the default one. NOTE: Press 'q' in the command prompt when you are done with the recording. This holds true for every other recording feature.
* "***audio recorder*** _AudioName_" records audio. Use "***audio recorder***", this will use default audio "Microphone (Realtek High Definition Audio)".
